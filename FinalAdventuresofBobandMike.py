In this situation there are 2 options! start searching in all cars or hack into the cameras from the cars Mike and I woke up in rubbles thinking we made something go wrong and ended up in an explosion Bob - 'Are you okay?' Mike - 'Yes i'm fine, are you okay?, I think we messed up and broke the whole place' Bob - 'it does sure look like it maybe it was some protection against a wrong code, anyways let's get up and leaves this place as soon as possible' after getting up from the rubble both Mike and Bob are confused as the place they are in doesn't look like the laboratory they entered prior to the explosion after leaving the laboratory they see that nothing is like what it was everything is either ruined or really well keep like an mix of post-apocalyptic with technology advanced future they start to walk down until they hear a group men shouting at them to run and hide so bob and mike ran at the men without thinking and when after them after which they hear gun shots 'what was that' said mike but nobody said anything and the group of men just put their fingers on their mouths to show to bob and mike to be quite minutes pass and one of the men finally speaks which division are you from? To which Mike replies 'divsion? What do you mean' the unidentified man says 'I am Colonel Manson the leader of this division where did you two get here are did you forget about the robots do you want to die?' mike replied 'what robots where are we ?' Manson' what do you mean what robots did you lose your memory?' at which point Mike and bob realised they have actually time traveled. Super Ai robot created by a super intelligent scientist learns how to create new robots and how to program them so they work for him and impressing scientist the humans. I'm sorry Colonel Manson this might sound really obscure but we are time travelers from 2022 and if we may ask you again what year is this? Colonel Manson 'This is Year 2200 Day 20 of the month July Time 11:21:53 now if i may ask you do you know not know nothing' we know nothing Colnel my name is Mike and this is bob Colnel manson 'well long story short Mike And bob the world has been over run by highly powered AI robots which overpowered their created dr Maddison and it's believed they have killed him and now we are trying to fight against them however they are much more powerful and much more intelligent than humans however we are really close to finding their main power switch as there is a legend that the robots can be disabled with a main switch. At this point mike and bob freal out and decide to run back to the time machine Mike says it's time to get back home, in their time! Mike and Bob are ready to go, they get in the machine and tried to start it! It does not work! Mike and Bob believed that the reason is the season because it is winter outside and many cars, even time machines, have problems at the 'first key'. They checked the dashboard where they saw a strange combinations of letter: Error 404 The user has not found! Please! Key = int(input(‘Enter the original key of Maddison Ray in binary: ‘) Mike and Bob undestood that they have a huge problem ahead! They are not able to get back in their time until they will find the scientist! The guys started to search for Maddison! Traveling in that times is not easy, because every street name is written using binary! They go in the city center, in Apple Square, trying to find any evidence about Maddison’s location. When they arrived in the Square, they observed something strange! The Square is changing! On every screen is a loading bar on which indicates the progress of a software update. The hole city is updating the software, so it is a maintenance break! The robots, which clean the streets, are freezing and the road is blocked by the self-driving cars! When the screen stopped at 99% and on the top of the screen appeared a code: 01001101 01100001 01100100 01100100 01101001 01110011 01101111 01101110 ( Maddison ) 01101001 01110011 01101001 01101110 01001101 01101001 01101110 01101001 ( is in Mini ) It is a bug which output the messages of the robots who captured Maddison! But Mike and Bob were not understanding what is a Mini! It is a special binary code? After they tried to decode the “01001101 01101001 01101110 01101001” which means Mini, they just google it! They found Mini Cooper which is a vintage car from England! Maddison is in this old and dusty car! Mike and Bob undestood that they will find Maddison at the vintage festival in Apple Square. Following the coordinates the colonel gave them, the boys head back to the hideout to relay the information they deciphered to him. Reaching the hideout they find the colonel deep in conversation with a few of the other soldiers. “Colonel!”, “Ah Bob, Mike where did you run off to? It’s very dangerous out there I told you to come straight to the hideout when you’re done”. “Sorry Colonel, but we have some news! It seems Dr. Maddison is in his Cooper according to what the code Tells us.” A look of confusion dawned on the colonel’s face. “How and what do you mean by that?” asked the colonel. “Well after we decrypted a code from a bug in the update server It said and I quote ‘Maddison is in Mini’,” replied Mike. “That’s some fantastic work boys” the colonel replied immediately gesturing for his intel team to come over. “Dr. Steinsgate, look we have a breakthrough”. Listening to the situation, Steinsgate’s eyes glittered immediately, “Oh my oh my Colonel I know exactly what we are looking for! Months ago my team and I stumbled on some information we got from one of the robots we captured. It had a damaged chip but we were able to salvage it, although there wasn’t much we could recover. One of the few things though was a reference code. What was it umm?...800689251008MINI. Yes, that was it but it was atop a barcode which when we scanned, which by the way took hours since it wasn’t the regular encryption we use, gave us the Model number and developer. Model number being the number I mentioned and developer being Mainframe Internetwork Intelligence, MINI for short. Do you get where I’m going with this?” Immediately it clicked in both the Colonel and the boys heads that MINI here isn’t a car but where the robots are made which is known to be the tall tinted building at the north end of the city, guarded by swarming robots. “This is where Maddison might be!” shouted the Colonel. “Yes, yes and they probably removed any information of this place on the internet making it impossible to link the code we decrypted to it if anyone ever found out, sending us on a wild goose chase.” Bob echoed. “But how are we gonna get in there? It’s heavily guarded and outright impossible to breach, in fact that whole place is a ghost town to humans since it’s densely populated by robots.” Replied the colonel. “We have to try, it’s our only shot, Bob and I need to get home and we’ll be sitting ducks as well if we just wait around doing nothing.” As though in a mental battle with himself the Colonel grumbled as he thought hard. “Fine, we’ll give it a shot but we need to hatch an intricate plan to enter the building, one devoid of any casualties as I’ve already lost so many men in this war already. We will gather first thing in the morning to discuss this in detail as it’s already night time and the Night patrollers will soon arrive. For now, we retire to our beds and recuperate. 01110111 01101000 01100101 01110010 01100101 00100000 01100001 01110010 01100101 00100000 01110100 01101000 01100101 00100000 01101000 01110101 01101101 01100001 01101110 01110011 00100001 (where are the humans!) communicate the robots among themselves. As a patrol vehicle exits at the scout site Bob and Mike understand that it is quite possible that the Colonel and his men are in danger. They quickly exit the campsite and each grabs a metal rod so they can use it for protection. They began following the patrol vehicle and reach the foot of the MINI building. Their theory was right. This seems to be the base of the robots. 'The Hive' as both state while gasping. They look up at the towering building and gulp with fear. In hopes of saving the Colonel and going back to their time, they have to enter this building. With the courage to finally enter, they both move amongst the robots and the walls of the corporation with complete stealth, not to be seen at all. They finally reach the elevators and go to the highest level of the building in hopes of reaching the Colonel and Dr Maddison. Enter the elevator")
